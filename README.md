Hello there!
This is my first website made with TailWindCSS (and a bit of JS - Java Script)!
I wanna give all credits to Dave Gray for the very professional-made tutorial on YouTube for begginers!

With all this in mind - enjoy my site!
If you want to see it live: here's the link: https://acme-rockets-du73.onrender.com.
